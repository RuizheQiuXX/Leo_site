"Hey there! I’m Ruizhe Qiu — born in China, trained in finance and analytics in Minnesota, and  sharpened my skills in business analytics at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. My journey blends quantitative insight with social impact, from internships to community redevelopment in the U.S. and China.",
